Hello, everyone! Sorry that this update took so long I'm planning some changes to how this site will function and look so expect changes to start being rolled out in the coming months.

### Content and Updates

So due to the delayed update and the content being planned I will not be releasing any updates to or new articles until the Nov 14th 2023.  I will return back to weekly once everything planned is released and running smoothly. I will continue minor bug fixes and blog grammar changes whenever I can. Those can usually be found at the bottom of a blog with plans for changes.

### Upcoming blogs

Next update, I will be releasing two post with the help of my IT friend [bailey] and my IT teacher. They each have their own post planned

This tutorial will walk you through the entire Arch Linux installation process, from start to finish. You can expect to find not only the basic installation steps but also tips and tricks that I've learned along the way. I'll even share some of my favorite apps and features that make Arch Linux stand out.

### Get in Touch

I encourage you to leave comments and feedback. As a developer, I value your insights, suggestions, and questions. Feel free to shoot me a comment, and I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

In the coming months, I'll work on improving the grammar and overall quality of the blogs. We all make mistakes, but we can also learn and grow from them. Your feedback will play a crucial role in making this blog a valuable resource.

Thank you for being a part of this journey with me. Stay tuned for more exciting content!
