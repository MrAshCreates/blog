# Update 1.0.3

Hello guys! You are probably thinking either of these two things being one "where is the update?" and/or "two where has this man been?" Well in all honesty I literally got lazy this past month and didn't do anything.

### Content and Updates

So first I want to announce the start of a news website that I am creating and I will have a new doc released at some point that will explain the process and progress of the site.
I finally finished the Arch guide and will start on the windows one. You can still expect customization guides but probably around when plasma 6 releases.
I don't really have any other updates this time so you will get more of a life update in this one.

### life update

So in the `firstblog` I went into a little detail on the idea of college and where I would go. Well I had decided on Neumont CS Uni until recently where I decided not to.
